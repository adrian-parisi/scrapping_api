# Out of Scope for Technical Interview

Features intentionally not implemented due to interview time constraints and complexity.

## What We're NOT Implementing

### Complex Multi-Tenant Architecture
- Generic base repository classes with automatic owner scoping
- PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Middleware-based owner context injection
- Database-level tenant isolation

### Advanced Security Features
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Real-time security monitoring
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Advanced authorization systems

### Performance Optimizations
- Tenant-aware connection pooling
- Multi-tenant caching strategies
- Database sharding by tenant
- Advanced query optimization

## Why These Are Out of Scope

- **Time**: Would require 2-3 days vs. 2-4 hours for interview
- **Complexity**: Current implementation already provides adequate security
- **Context**: Interview focuses on core skills, not production-scale architecture

## What We ARE Implementing

✅ **Basic Owner Scoping**: All queries filter by `owner_id`  
✅ **Authentication**: API key validation on all endpoints  
✅ **Security Testing**: 404 vs 403 behavior verification  
✅ **Clean Architecture**: Proper separation of concerns  

## Production Considerations

For a production system, we would add:
- Database-level RLS policies
- Centralized repository patterns
- Comprehensive monitoring and audit logs
- Performance optimizations for scale

**Goal**: Demonstrate good judgment in choosing appropriate solutions for the context.
